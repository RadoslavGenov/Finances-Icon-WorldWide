# Finances-Icon-WorldWide
Task for Icon-WorldWide Junior Developer Interview

For the task I decided to use a UIPageViewController, since it has two ways for the page transitioning styles, rather than 
the tab view. I have two custom cells for the Expense and Income table views. In my Expense and Income Controllers I use an extension
to put the alert logic, so the controllers look cleaner. I use a fetchedResultsController for coredata management, since I find it suits 
better table views. For the models, I have two models Expense and Income. I have also added localization string, for Bulgarian.
